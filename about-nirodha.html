                    <p class="text-description">The Nirodha Mindfulness Center is a newly opened, nonprofit
                        charity organization inspired and founded by Dr. Trinh Tran, a highly respected physician and
                        rheumatologist with over 35 of years of experience in patient care, providing in-person and
                        online classes, and training in mindfulness practice. Through Dr. Tran's class offerings, she
                        aims to help individuals of all ages and faiths learn the skills necessary to incorporate
                        mindfulness practice into their daily lives. Through dedication to mindfulness practice, she
                        hopes to help people learn ways to calm and center the mind on the present moment.</p>

                    <p class="text-description">The practice of learning compassion towards the self, and to experience
                        thoughts without
                        judgment,
                        reduces the mind’s tendency to ruminate and become preoccupied by thoughts, patterns, and
                        beliefs that create distress or prolong suffering. Dr. Tran affirms the evidence available
                        supports mindfulness practice as an effective method for reducing stress, anxiety, and pain;
                        boosting attention, focus, and resilience; and enhancing the health and well-being of those who
                        practice it. Our classes are led by community volunteers who have received specialized training
                        in mindfulness practice and have personally experienced the lifechanging benefits of regular
                        mindfulness practice.</p>
                    <p>With gratitude from the entire staff at Nirodha Mindfulness Center.</p>

                    <p class="text-description">The Nirodha Mindfulness Center, Inc. (Nirodha) is dedicated to sharing
                        methods to generate love,
                        kindness, compassion and wisdom within Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Nirodha is approved by
                        the Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) public charity, which means that your contributions
                        to us are tax deductible. Nirodha has no paid staff. Our meditation instructors are all
                        volunteers. We utilize your donations to prepare for larger workshops in rented facilities. Also
                        for our larger workshops, we invite instructors from other meditation centers to teach and we
                        compensate them for their travel expenses. We provide educational materials for these workshops
                        and supplies. When we come together in small groups or large groups, there is power, and this
                        power creates change through meditating together, building community and envisioning change in
                        the world.</p>
                    <p class="text-description">Nirodha is non-sectarian. The practice of meditation and mindfulness is
                        a great way to improve
                        one's health, outlook, and deepen one's appreciation of their own religion. Even if one has no
                        faith, meditation can help the individual practitioner get "in touch" with both mind and body,
                        creating harmony between the two, and improving one's quality of life. </p>
                    <p class="text-description">Your gift, large or small, is important. When you give, it reflects your
                        desire to contribute to
                        a Center that is determined to help you thrive in an overly complex world. Your gifts also
                        create new possibilities for all the good Nirodha can accomplish in Central Indiana. Become part
                        of the power of change and consider a one time end-of-year gift or become a monthly supporter of
                        Nirodha. </p>

                            <p class="text-description">Trinh Tran MD was born in Vietnam. She left Vietnam in 1984 and
                                entered Guy’s and St.
                                Thomas’s Medical and Dental schools (now merged with King’s College) in London, England
                                in 1988. After graduating from medical school, she did two years of training in England
                                then moved to the US to complete her residency in Internal medicine at the Medical
                                College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee.</p>
                            <p class="text-description">After 2 years working as a hospitalist, she entered a
                                Rheumatology fellowship at Duke
                                medical center in Durham, North Carolina and graduated from the fellowship program in
                                2005. After working in both private practice setting and major health system, she
                                started her own private practice in Rheumatology in Noblesville/Westfield, Indiana.
                                Recognizing stress as a major triggering factor for flare up of autoimmune inflammatory
                                diseases and knowing many research proven health benefits of meditation, she decided to
                                learn how to meditate with Venerable Thích Thiện Trí. She then became his assistant in
                                organizing the meditation classes. She volunteered her time after work and at the
                                weekends in hosting online classes and assisted in guiding the meditation for the basic
                                classes. </p>
                            <p class="text-description">Her goal is to provide her patients with the skills and tools of
                                meditation, helping to
                                reduce stress in their lives and disease activity. Meditation helps people in achieving
                                a stable happy peaceful life, and it is Dr. Tran’s hope to bring the service to all, not
                                just patients, since we all will encounter stress in our lives. </p>

                            <p class="text-description">My name is Josmara Alvarado and I’m Puerto Rican living in the
                                Midwest. I have four
                                unique and very special kids, a loving and supporting husband, and I’m a mom to Sir
                                Frankie, my assistance and emotional support standard poodle.</p>
                            <p class="text-description">After many years of teaching at different school levels, life
                                puts me through tests,as it
                                often does, and in 2017 I started a battle with my health. It has been a long journey of
                                trials and errors, trying different approaches to manage all that comes along when you
                                have Lupus as well as Lupus Arthritis and the umbrella of underlying autoimmune
                                diseases. I learned through acceptance and compassion that all is possible, even living
                                at ease with the physical or emotional pain you are experiencing.</p>
                            <p class="text-description">As of right now, I’m an energy healing arts practitioner and
                                Reiki Master Teacher; I also
                                offer spiritual coaching and special sessions for the dying and their families,
                                providing them some comfort and compassion during their grieving process.</p>
                            <p class="text-description">I believe in the alignment of our four bodies and living in
                                divine harmony from within;
                                attaining overall wellness and a sense of balance and bliss. For the past 10 years I've
                                been serving others through my private practice; leading them during their journey and
                                serving as guidance, helping them get in touch with their inner selves and, at the same
                                time, find some self healing and freedom.</p>

                                to the passion she had for inspiring women to gain wholeness and success in life. Though
                                she has coached many individuals over the years in business settings and one-on-one, she
                                knew there was something that she was missing in her practice. Meditation was becoming
                                increasingly more of a focus in her life; seeing how the practice provided her with
                                self-discovery and greater peace in her life, she wanted to share with others in her
                                coaching practice.

                                and Allure Dance and Fitness in Indianapolis, Indiana has provided her with an
                                additional way to connect with the body and movement in a way that provides freedom.</p>
